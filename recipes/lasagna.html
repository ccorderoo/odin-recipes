        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). Despite the traditional form still being popular, lasagna has taken on
        many different recipes over the years.</p>
        <p>This will be the most <strong>delicious one!</strong></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound(450g) groound beef</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can(28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sal</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the onion is softened.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and chopped parsley. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of the meat sauce. Sprinkle some mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of meat sauce and a generous amount of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before serving. This will make it easier to cut and serve.</li>
        </ol>

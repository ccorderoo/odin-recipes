        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A dessert consisting of a thick, creamy filling of cheese, eggs, and sugar over a thinner crust and topped oreos.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Crust:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>24 Oreo cookes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup(56g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cheesecake Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 packages (24 ounces/680g) cream cheese, softened </li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>12 Oreo cookies, coarsely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Topping:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>6 Oreo cookies, crushed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Grease a 9-inch (23cm) springform pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>For the crust, place the 24 Oreo cookies in a food processor and pulse until finely crushed. Alternatively, you can place the cookies in a zip-top bag and crush them with a rolling pin. Transfer the crushed cookies to a bowl and mix in the melted butter until well combined.</li>
            <li>Press the cookie mixture into the bottom of the prepared springform pan, creating an even layer. Use the bottom of a glass or measuring cup to firmly press the crust down. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the sour cream and mix until just combined. Gently fold in the coarsely chopped Oreo cookies.</li>
            <li>Pour the cheesecake filling over the prepared crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Place the springform pan on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 55-60 minutes, or until the center of the cheesecake is set and slightly jiggly.</li>
            <li>Once the cheesecake is baked, turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the oven door slightly ajar for about 1 hour to cool gradually. This helps prevent the cheesecake from cracking.</li>
            <li>After cooling at room temperature, refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to set completely.</li>
            <li>Just before serving, prepare the topping. In a chilled mixing bowl, beat the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Remove the cheesecake from the springform pan and transfer it to a serving plate. Pipe or spread the whipped cream on top of the cheesecake and sprinkle the crushed Oreo cookies over the whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve the delicious Oreo Cheesecake to enjoy its creamy and chocolaty goodness!</li>

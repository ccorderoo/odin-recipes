        <img src="/images/wings.jpeg" alt="Hot Honey Wings">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Deep-fried unbreaded chicken wings or drumsticks coated with hot honey rub. They commonly are served with celery and a ranch dipping sauce, which acts as a cooling agent for the mouth.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds (900g) chicken wings</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup hot sauce (such as Frank's RedHot)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for extra heat)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, black pepper, and paprika. Coat each chicken wing with the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Place the coated wings on a wire rack to rest for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fill a large, deep skillet or pot with vegetable oil, ensuring there's enough oil to fully submerge the wings. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches about 350°F (175°C)</li>
            <li>Carefully add the chicken wings to the hot oil in batches, being cautious not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the wings for
            about 10-12 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove the wings from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Stir in the hot sauce, honey, apple cider vinegar, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). Cook the sauce for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally, until well combined and heated through.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, toss the fried chicken wings with the hot honey sauce, ensuring each wing is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Serve the wings immediately and enjoy them while they're still hot and saucy!</li>
        </ol>
